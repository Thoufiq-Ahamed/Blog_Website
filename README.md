# Blog_Website
This repository contains the code of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and AJAX for the Blog Web Application.
**NOTE**: This Website can't developed by Yii Framework as it is new to me. So, this application is developed by basic php scripts.

The program starts with index.php. 

The Main Functionalities are:
  1. Login, Logout, Register, Forgot Password (in simple terms,Form Validation) using PHP.
  2. Basic and Simple Blog Application using HTML, CSS, Javascript.
  3. Blog Posts are stored in Mysql Database(as i have XAMPP Control Panel, i used the DB of phpmyadmin).
  4. As i mentioned earlier, the main page is Index.PHP. I shown the login/logout differences in accessibility of buttons, texts and some. For Example, if the user logged in, then only he can access the other's blog posts. Otherwise, the text are blurred and also links are not working(Means, it shows alert warning.).
  5. Used AJAX for one functionality that the list of blogs are updated and also when we clicked on those links/buttons, it shown the corresponding blog.

Finally, because of the time consumption i took for submission, i didn't worked on search bar and search button. Apologize for that !! :(

Thanks for waiting and understanding!!

Have a Great Day!!
